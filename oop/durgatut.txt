data hidding:
	
	     1)outside person cant access our internal data directly
	     2)our internal data should not go out directly
	     3)by declaring data member(var) as private we can achieve data hidding.


Abstraction:

		hiding internal implementation and just highlight the set of service
		we are offering is a concept of abstraction.
		
		advantages:

			a)security
			b)enhacement becomes easy
			c)maintainance is easy

Encapsulation:

		the process of binding data member and the corresponding methods into a 
		single unit is nothng but encapsulation.
		data hidind + abstraction == encapsulation.

		advantage: we can achieve security
		disadvantage: it increases length of code and slows down execution.


tightly encapsulation class:

				each and every variable in a class is declare as 
				a private then it is tigthly encapsulation.
				whether class contains correspoding getter and setter methods 
				and whether these method declare as public or not we are not
				require to check.

				if parent class is not tightly encapsulated than no child class
				is tightly encapsulated.
